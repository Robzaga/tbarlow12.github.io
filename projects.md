# - [PomoSphero](https://www.hackster.io/tbarlow12/pomosphero-905d04?ref=user&ref_id=62953&offset=0)
  This was a fun, fairly simple project once I was able to find the right resources. Works mostly with asynchronous timers that continuously update the RGB value of the Sphero, and then rolls back and forth when timer is completed.
