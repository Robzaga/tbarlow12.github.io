- [PomoSphero](https://www.hackster.io/tbarlow12/pomosphero-905d04?ref=user&ref_id=62953&offset=0)
  This was a fun, fairly simple project once I was able to find the right resources. Works mostly with asynchronous timers that continuously update the RGB value of the Sphero, and then rolls back and forth when timer is completed.

- [Asteroids](https://github.com/tbarlow12/Asteroids)
  This started as an assignment for a class to build the classic video game 'Asteroids', but my teammate and I kept adding features. We implemented cheat codes, additional weapons, extra bonuses and more.

- [AskD](https://github.com/tbarlow12/AskD)
  My mother-in-law told me that she wanted a program to organize her filing cabinet of documents where each document had its own index. The documents also could have categories, keywords, titles, authors and other features. I implemented this lightweight desktop application in Java to quickly search by any of those attributes. She gave it the name AskD in honor of her own name.

- [SpriteEditor](https://github.com/University-of-Utah-CS3505/u0680482/tree/neverland-dev/A6-SpriteEditor)
  The SpriteEditor is an application to edit pixels and frames with the end goal of exporting it to gif. This was done in a team for a school project, but has since been expanded on as team members have implemented more features
