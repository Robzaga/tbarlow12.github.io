# Interests 
A lot of the work I have done in school, internships and in side projects has been focused on data science and artificial intelligence. Some of my favorite courses I have taken have been in **natural language processing**, **information extraction** and **machine learning**. Go [here]() to read more about some of my favorite projects.

## Technologies I'm Currently Teaching Myself:
- Apache Spark
- Microsoft Bot Framework
- Tensorflow
- Cognitive Toolkit

## Technologies On-Deck
- Serverless Computing
- Blockchain

## Side Projects I'm Currently Working On:
- [**"Learn It Your Way"**]() - My own Flask API for users to upload a dataset, train one or more models and have a REST endpoint to hit for future predictions

    <li><b>Project</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Implemented a Java desktop application for a team of non-technical geographical researchers to perform bulk operations on massive dataset of places. </li>
        </ul>
    <li><b>Results</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Application saved thousands of hours of manual entry.</li>
            <li>Initial scope of project was to build a command-line tool to perform operations, but upon meeting the team and hearing their frustrations about using the command-line when they didn't have a technical background, I took it upon myself to add a GUI to the tool, also speeding up the time to learn the tool and use it.</li>
            <li>Finished project 4 weeks ahead of schedule, which gave me the opportunity of participating in the planning, design and prototyping of a REST API to perform similar operations.</li>

            <li>Saved team time and money by eliminating need for manual scanning of customer feedbacks.</li>
            <li>Worked alongside internal data science team and beta-tested the newest features of an internal NLP engine, discovering bugs and areas for improvement.</li>
            <li>Finished project early, which allowed me to start laying the groundwork for automatically grouping semantically similar feedbacks and combining them under the same bug.</li>

# Personal 
I'm married to the most beautiful girl in the world and we have an awesome baby boy. 

I've loved basketball since I could walk (I grew up with a dad and grandpa that coached for 30+ years each), and John Wooden is one of my all-time heroes. For some of my favorite "Wooden-isms", visit [this blog post]().

Cheeseburgers are my Kryptonite and I can't get enough of super-hero movies, but my absolute favorite things in the world are dance parties with my wife and making my son laugh 'till he squeels.
