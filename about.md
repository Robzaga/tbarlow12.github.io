I'm married to the most beautiful girl in the world and we have an awesome baby boy. 

I've loved basketball since I could walk (I grew up with a dad and grandpa that coached for 30+ years each), and John Wooden is one of my all-time heroes (for some of my favorite "Wooden-isms", visit [this blog post]()).

Cheeseburgers are my Kryptonite and I can't get enough of super-hero movies, but my absolute favorite things in the world are dance parties with my wife and making my son laugh 'till he squeels.
