# Interests
A lot of the work I have done in school, internships and in side projects has been focused on data science and artificial intelligence. Some of my favorite courses I have taken have been in **natural language processing**, **information extraction** and **machine learning**. Go [here]() to read more about some of my favorite projects.

## Technologies I'm Currently Teaching Myself:
- Apache Spark
- Microsoft Bot Framework
- Tensorflow
- Cognitive Toolkit

## Technologies On-Deck
- Serverless Computing
- Blockchain

## Side Projects I'm Currently Working On:
- [**"Learn It Your Way"**]() - My own Flask API for users to upload a dataset, train one or more models and have a REST endpoint to hit for future predictions





# Experience

## Internships

### 2015 - **FamilySearch** 
- **Project** 
    - Implemented a Java desktop application for a team of non-technical geographical researchers to perform bulk operations on massive dataset of places. 
- **Results** 
    - Application saved thousands of hours of manual entry. 
    - Initial scope of project was to build a command-line tool to perform operations, but upon meeting the team and hearing their frustrations about using the command-line when they didn't have a technical background, I took it upon myself to add a GUI to the tool, also speeding up the time to learn the tool and use it.
    - Finished project 4 weeks ahead of schedule, which gave me the opportunity of participating in the planning, design and prototyping of a REST API to perform similar operations.

### 2016 - **Microsoft (WDG)**
- **Project** 
    - Automated process of identifying meaningful customer feedback for international Windows users and passing it along to appropriate team.
- **Results**
    - Saved team time and money by eliminating need for manual scanning of customer feedbacks
    - Worked alongside internal data science team and beta-tested the newest features of an internal NLP engine, discovering bugs and areas for improvement.
    - Finished project early, which allowed me to start laying the groundwork for automatically grouping semantically similar feedbacks and combining them under the same bug.

### 2017 - **Microsoft (WDG)**
- **Project**
    - Identify "communities" of Windows devices and provide means to amplify voice of devices representing large communities
- **Results**
    - Built automated data pipeline for Windows telemetry that was meaningful to the Localization team
    - Implemented clustering workflow to group similar devices within a language population
    - Created metric that determined how many devices each device represented based on the centrality of that device within their respective cluster, *allowing team to predict approximate impact the feedback from those devices could have*.

## Full-Time
### Jan. 2018 - present - **Microsoft (CSE)**
- Currently working for the Commercial Software Engineering (CSE) team at Microsoft
- We develop new technologies with partners to solve their biggest technical challenges
- Stay tuned for upcoming adventures!



# Personal
I'm married to the most beautiful girl in the world and we have an awesome baby boy. 

I've loved basketball since I could walk (I grew up with a dad and grandpa that coached for 30+ years each), and John Wooden is one of my all-time heroes. For some of my favorite "Wooden-isms", visit [this blog post]().

Cheeseburgers are my Kryptonite and I can't get enough of super-hero movies, but my absolute favorite things in the world are dance parties with my wife and making my son laugh 'till he squeels.

I'm an avid basketball player and served an LDS mission in Santiago, Chile. 

But I've also done a lot of work across the spectrum of software development. I'm currently the only backend developer for Guide, a crowd-sourced virtual travel guide application that allows users to upload "waypoints" (points of interest on a guided tour) with audio, pictures and text information to share with other users. I'm responsible for the REST API, SQL database and other components such as Azure Blob Storage and Azure Media Services. I also assist with the development of the Android mobile application.

For the past two summers, I've worked with the Windows localization team on data science problems involving the millions of global users and devices running Windows. My first summer was focused mainly on automating the process of identifying and flagging meaningful feedback using in-house NLP/ML technologies. It was an amazing project and our team saw some great success. For a more detailed description of my experience that first summer, click [here](Microsoft-Summer1/). My most recent summer was spent trying to find a way to discover "communities" within windows devices by aggregating data about those devices and using that to build out clusters of similar devices, giving each one a score that indicated how "representative" of their cluster they were. I have yet to log my experience here, but stay tuned!

Since then, I've signed an offer to return to Microsoft, working with the [Partner Catalyst Team](https://github.com/CatalystCode), where we work with outside organizations around the globe to solve new problems and build cool stuff. I was able to work with a few members of my new team in a Microsoft corporate hackathon (OneWeek), where I was able to witness first-hand how talented this team really is. I'm humbled and excited for the opportunity to work with and learn from them.

Speaking of hackathons, I think they are the perfect opportunity to learn new technologies and build cool stuff in a short amount of time. I've been involved with hackathons and coding competitions throughout my career. One of my favorite experiences was traveling with a team to Philadelphia for PennApps, where we built a Flask API for people to upload a dataset and get an endpoint to host their own ML models without needing to think about the nitty-gritty of machine learning. I co-founded and have been the Director of Technology for [HackTheU](http://hacktheu.com/), the official University of Utah hackathon, for the past two years. It was an amazing(ly stressful) experience to organize such a large event (our most recent hackathon had 270+ participant attendees) and partner with reputable companies like Galileo Processing, Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, Instructure, and many others.
