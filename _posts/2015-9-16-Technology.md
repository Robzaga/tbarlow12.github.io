title: A Lifetime Passion For Technology
---

I have a passion for technology and its ability to improve the day-to-day experience.

One of the first experiences I had with how much technology was when I was 10 years old. I wanted an efficient way to keep an inventory of my baseball cards. My problem was that I traded cards so often that I would have to re-write or re-sort that list every time I made a trade. I discovered a spreadsheet application on my dad's computer that I used to sort my cards by year, team, player, stats, how much money the card would make me one day, etc., etc., etc. I could sort the information however I wanted and I was hooked.

Throughout high school, I still made technology a part of every day, using it to create family highlight movies, write essays, learn new subjects and everything else that many high-schoolers do, but a lot of my time was dedicated to playing basketball, participating in student government and community organizations. If someone had asked me if I knew how to "code", I'd think they were talking about cheat codes for Madden on the PS2, and computer programming was just some mystical profession that involved

I served an LDS mission in Santiago, Chile, where I met some incredible people, served as many as I could and learned more than I could ever explain. I used my experience with technology (with somewhat limited resources) to increase the efficiency of the work that we did. I liked working hard, but there was nothing that I loathed more than wasted effort and inefficient labor. So I did what I could to organize the effort electronically, use different media channels to spread our message and only produced crude approximations of the things I dreamt of. (I should mention that soon after I returned home, many missionaries begain using iPads and mobile applications that performed the exact functions I was hoping for... Just my luck)

After my first semester back at the University of Utah, I'll never forget how I felt when I started making basic "toy" programs using Scratch (basic programming teaching tool). My friend and I used Scratch to create a simulated football "Kickoff Return" game. Players would run around a miniature field, and the user's job was to get the ball to the other endzone without being tackled by the opposition. It was a simple game, but I was enthralled that we could add feature upon feature upon feature to make it a game actually worth playing. While creating games has never been part of what I wanted to do with my life, I was amazed that I had created something like that.

Since then I have soaked up every bit of information I can to become the best coder I can be. I spent my first year writing programs in Java and learning about the core algorithms and data structures that make modern programming possible. During that school year, I received an offer for a Software Development internship at FamilySearch, where I worked with a team of data specialists to maintain a database of all the "places" in the world (over 7 million points of data). Those places would be used in helping patrons research their own family history. I loved my team, the challenges I faced every day, and the cause we were involved in.

During the summer, I was also involved with a friend in several side projects, one of which is an interactive and predictive course planner for students at the University of Utah. We weren't quite satisfied with the degree-planning tools provided by the university, so we decided to create our own. It is still being developed.

I'm currently back in school, learning everything I can and looking for the next challenge.
