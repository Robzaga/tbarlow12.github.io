When I first interviewed with Microsoft in 2015, my wife and I saw it as a free trip to Seattle. In my head, I was nowhere near qualified to work at a place like that and had all but written myself off from the start. The Imposter Syndrome was as real as ever. But I did promise her earlier that year that I would take us some place out of Utah that summer for an internship of some kind, so I really did want it to work out.

I didn't feel great about my interviews - a couple of them felt downright terrible. But I did try hard to explain my thought process and walk my interviewers through my solution to the problems they presented. After four hours of interviews, I went to lunch at the Commons with the other candidates, many of whom were from schools like CMU, Harvard, MIT, etc. Not that I'm not proud to be a Ute, because I always will be. But at the time there was just something about those big name schools that made me feel so small. We came back from lunch, where the recruiters handed out Microsoft hoodies and swag (pretty much a participation trophy for interviewing, but **score** nonetheless). I was just about to head out the door to go back to the hotel, intent on enjoying the rest of the weekend in Seattle with my sweet wife, when one of the recruiters I had spent some time chatting to pulled me aside.

We went into a nearby conference room, where he explained that they had an offer on the table for me. Shock doesn't begin to describe what I was feeling. He pulled in another recruiter, the one I had first reached out to over a year previous to express my interest. It was cool to see that they were genuinely excited for me. I think they were more excited for me to tell my wife that I came through on my promise. I called Kate as soon as I left the building and could barely contain my excitement as I tried to explain what just happened, not really knowing the answer. We spent the night in downtown Seattle, fully able to relax and imagine what our summer would be like in this new place.
