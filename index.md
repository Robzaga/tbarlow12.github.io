I like to take initiative in my learning and am not afraid to ask questions when I don’t understand. I think building relationships and generating loyalty is a very important skill I have and goes very well with honesty. I am a very honest worker and have learned to work hard while being paid.

*Open* to do different things and to do things differently.
