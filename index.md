Hi, my name's Tanner Barlow. I'm a full-stack software engineer and data scientist. I currently work at Microsoft with the Commercial Software Engineering team. Find out more about me and my background [here](about/).

In my free time, I work as a freelancer/consultant. I love to work on projects with any connection to machine learning, natural language processing and backend development. Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/tbarlow12) for my portfolio.
