My name is Tanner Barlow and I am a software engineer and data scientist.

A lot of the work I have done in school, internships and in side projects has been focused on data science. I am particularly passionate about natural language processing and machine learning for their ability to connect the real world to the power of computing. I love building intelligent solutions to everyday problems and using beautiful math to do it. But I've also done a lot of work across the spectrum of software development. I'm currently the only backend developer for Guide, a crowd-sourced virtual travel guide application that allows users to upload "waypoints" (points of interest on a guided tour) with audio, pictures and text information to share with other users. I'm responsible for the REST API, SQL database and other components such as Azure Blob Storage and Azure Media Services. I also assist with the development of the Android mobile application.

For the past two summers, I've worked with the Windows localization team on data science problems involving the millions of global users and devices running Windows. My first summer was focused mainly on automating the process of identifying and flagging meaningful feedback using in-house NLP/ML technologies. It was an amazing project and our team saw some great success. For a more detailed description of my experience that first summer, click [here](Microsoft-Summer1/). My most recent summer was spent trying to find a way to discover "communities" within windows devices by aggregating data about those devices and using that to build out clusters of similar devices, giving each one a score that indicated how "representative" of their cluster they were. I have yet to log my experience here, but stay tuned!

Since then, I've signed an offer to return to Microsoft, working with the [Partner Catalyst Team](https://github.com/CatalystCode), where we work with outside organizations around the globe to solve new problems and build cool stuff. I was able to work with a few members of my new team in a Microsoft corporate hackathon (OneWeek), where I was able to witness first-hand how talented this team really is. I'm humbled and excited for the opportunity to work with and learn from them.

Speaking of hackathons, I think they are the perfect opportunity to learn new technologies and build cool stuff in a short amount of time. I've been involved with hackathons and coding competitions throughout my career. One of my favorite experiences was traveling with a team to Philadelphia for PennApps, where we built a Flask API for people to upload a dataset and get an endpoint to host their own ML models without needing to think about the nitty-gritty of machine learning. I co-founded and have been the Director of Technology for [HackTheU](http://hacktheu.com/), the official University of Utah hackathon, for the past two years. It was an amazing(ly stressful) experience to organize such a large event (our most recent hackathon had 270+ participant attendees) and partner with reputable companies like Galileo Processing, Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, Instructure, and many others.

I'm married to the most beautiful girl in the world, we have a beautiful baby boy, I'm an avid basketball player and served an LDS mission in Santiago, Chile.
