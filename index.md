My name is Tanner Barlow and I am a software engineer.

I love writing code to optimize and improve things I see in the real world. I've been able to use my skills developing software to make a real impact and I've loved every minute of it.

In 2016, I had the opportunity of working with the WDG GS Data Insights team at Microsoft (thank heavens for acronyms). For a more detailed description of the project I worked on, technical challenges I faced, and my overall experience in Redmond, please click [here](blog/Microsoft-Summer1/).

I spent the summer of 2015 as a Software Development intern with FamilySearch in Salt Lake City, where I developed tools for a team of data specialists to maintain a database of over 7 million points of data.

I am most interested in natural language processing, data mining, machine learning and all other technologies involving the transformation of data into useful tools and information.

I serve as the [president](http://www.cpuofu.com/board/) of a student group at the University of Utah called [CPU of U](http://www.cpuofu.com/), where we build software and explore different technologies outside of the classroom. I also sit on the Executive Board of [HackTheU](http://hacktheu.com/), the University of Utah sponsored Hackathon, and act as the Director of Technology for that organization

I'm married to the most beautiful girl in the world, I'm an avid basketball player and served an LDS mission in Santiago, Chile.
