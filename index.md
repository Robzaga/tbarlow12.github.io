I spent the summer of 2015 as a Software Development intern with FamilySearch in Salt Lake City, where I developed tools for a team of data specialists to maintain a database of over 7 million points of data. I have recently accepted a Software Engineer Internship with Microsoft, which will begin in May of 2016.

I am most interested in data mining, machine learning and all other technologies involving the transformation of data into useful tools and information.

I serve as the [president](http://www.cpuofu.com/board/) of a student group at the University of Utah called [CPU of U](http://www.cpuofu.com/), where we build software and explore different technologies outside of the classroom.

I'm married to the most beautiful girl in the world, I'm an avid basketball player and served an LDS mission in Santiago, Chile.
