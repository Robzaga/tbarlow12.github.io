A lot of the work I have done in school and internship has been focused on C++ and C#. Some of my favorite courses I have taken have been in **Advanced High Performance Computer Architecture**, **Embedded Systems 1 & 2** and **Senior Design Project**. Go [here](projects.md) to read more about some of my favorite projects.


# Personal

I have a beautiful wife that I love who spends her days with our daughter, who is one year old, as a stay at home mom while working part-time with a group of adults who are mentally challenged. We love spending time together out of the home with activities such as bowling, swimming, going to the park, and spending time with the grandparents. We recently bought a home in American Fork and weâ€™re so excited to make it our own. My wife and I love to go to the movies with our group of friends to see the latest blockbusters. My favorite movies are from Marvel and Disney.
