A lot of the work I have done in school and internship has been focused on C++ and C#. Some of my favorite courses I have taken have been in **Advanced High Performance Computer Architecture**, **Embedded Systems 1 & 2** and **Senior Design Project**.

# Personal

I have a beautiful wife and we have a gorgeous daughter, who is almost a one-year-old. Being a husband and father has been the best and most rewarding experience I've had.

I love the Marvel Cinematic Universe along with other action packed movies. My wife and I love to go to Megaplex Theatres with our friends to see the latest blockbusters, especially in the summer. I am very passionate about spending my free time with my family doing activities. I feel like our personal relationships are the most important to maintain.
