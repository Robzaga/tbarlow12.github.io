            <li>Implemented a Java desktop application for a team of non-technical geographical researchers to perform bulk operations on massive dataset of places. </li>

            <li>Application saved thousands of hours of manual entry.</li>
            <li>Initial scope of project was to build a command-line tool to perform operations, but upon meeting the team and hearing their frustrations about using the command-line when they didn't have a technical background, I took it upon myself to add a GUI to the tool, also speeding up the time to learn the tool and use it.</li>
            <li>Finished project 4 weeks ahead of schedule, which gave me the opportunity of participating in the planning, design and prototyping of a REST API to perform similar operations.</li>
