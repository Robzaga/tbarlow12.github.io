  "Rob always has a great attitude and is very dependable. He has a great work ethic, especially with time charging. Rob
continually comes up with self-generated ideas to make the process better and he bounces those ideas off his teammates to
make sure they are on-target. He is clear and concise, not just in speaking, but in his writing. The Process Model Toolkit project
was a collaborative effort and Rob is an excellent team player."
